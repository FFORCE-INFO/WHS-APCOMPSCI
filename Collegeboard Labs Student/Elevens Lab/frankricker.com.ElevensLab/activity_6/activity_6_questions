List all possible plays for the board 5 4 2 6 A J K 5 2
one of the 5's + 6 one of the 2 + A
If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, and K? Why or why not?
Yes, because it would not be possible to win otherwise
Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter
which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer.
Yes because you have to think about the probable future when you have different choices.  The game is basically a random chance game but, if you line up our moves right you can influence your luck
